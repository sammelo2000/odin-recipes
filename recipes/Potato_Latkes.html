<h2> soft and sweet</h2>
<p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really 
wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly
the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they
disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely
topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
    
    <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
    
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    
    <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
    
    <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
    
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a 
        large bowl.</li>
    
    <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    
    <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture 
        against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; 
        slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so 
        they are an even thickness.</li>
    <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per 
        side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
